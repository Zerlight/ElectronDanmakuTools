## Someting to Say ##

This app is coded for the graduation ceremony of my Junior high school. I finished the basic functions in 2 hours on the eve of that.(Pretty slow coding, isn't it?)

Well, I will probably not carry on with this any more. Maybe a sudden in the future...

### Functions to do: ###

1.User management system (User register & login, Danmaku limits)

2.Admin backend (Ban/limit a user, delete a Danmaku, maybe examine Danmakus...)

3.Unhealthy words detection (Automaticly refuse an unhealthy Danmaku and report to admins)

4.Danmaku colors and other format settings UI on Public User's webpage
